# Yet Another Reddit Clone

## Disclaimer

I was not building this to show off my UX design skills. I promise that I won't try to implement something this ugly in production

## About

Yet Another Reddit Clone (YARC) is a simplified version of reddit.
It allows the user to view links (via r/all or various subreddits),
post link or text, upvote links, and post comments. I want to keep
this project small, so I will not be adding features like a "hot"
sort, nested comments, or anything but the most minimal features.

## Why I Built This

I have enterprise Vue and Angular experience. These are core parts
of my full stack resume. I do not have enterprise react experience.
I view this as an item of concern. React is by far the most popular
framework out there and I only have limited experience. While
nothing can replace enterprise development, I want to get a basic
understanding of the framework so I can jump right in

## Technologies Used

- React
- Typescript
