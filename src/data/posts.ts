    content: `So I picked up eggs straight from the farm at the farmers market. Wondering if there will be anything I will notice in them from standard eggs bought at the grocery store in Canada/USA. Will they last less time before going back? Will there be a taste difference? Anything I should be aware of.\nThe description states: "We raise a variety of heritage laying hens that live outside.  It's only during the winter that they have the option of coming indoors.\n\nIn addition to plants, insects & mice (yes, you read that right - chickens are carnivores) they eat certified organic grains.\nOur eggs are cleaned but NOT disinfected or graded and are ONLY available directly from the farm"\nThese are the eggs: https://www.instagram.com/p/CYaTzyBtD5U/`,

      "I poisoned my wife and her family on New Years with fucking dried beans",
    votes: 152,
    subredditId: "cooking",
    content: `\nThe title says it all. I made an Italian wedding soup. Usually I sub in a can of Cannellini beans. It’s quick, it’s simple, it’s tasty, the internet told me to.\n\nBut my wife bought special beans. What makes these beans special? Probably the fucking marketing, but they were on the shelf, dried, in a small plastic bag touting the wonderful properties of beans. She bought them at a bean store in San Francisco. Only in SF could there be a fucking bean store during a pandemic. Great fanfare was made over this package of beans.\n\nWe soaked them for like an hour, tossed them in when we’d normally toss in the can of beans. Cooked another 15 minutes, and served. They were… crunchy, but the broth flavor was really good, so we figured “meh, eat this bowl, let it keep cooking.” Kinda like slightly undercooked rice, you know?\n\nI did not know.\n\nMy wife’s sister went first. There was unexplained running during a movie.\n\nMy wife went second. Two down.\n\nI’m now sitting on the couch by myself with the pets listening to my brother in law make pterodactyl noises with distant cough/vomit sounds in the background from my wife and sister-in-law like a gross harmony.\n\nWe’re out of toilets to puke in. I’m feeling about a 7/10. I have yet to determine if time is a friend or an enemy for me tonight.\n\nTurns out, dried beans need to be soaked for 5 hours, then boiled, and always eaten very tender.\n\nThank you for this final lesson 2021. “Purging the past” jokes are being received poorly by all those involved.\n\nAnyways, it’s 9:30 here. Happy new year. Here’s to fucking 2022.`,

    content: `She has internal scarring, and might is able to have a liquid diet for the most part, but was a foodie (she is 35) and is mourning her current state. Feeding tube and nutrient shakes are keeping her alive. Anyone have a brilliant way to provide flavor? Fibre is out, a seeds, pretty much anything interesting is blocked.

Can't thank you enough for all your support and kind words. Thanks!`,

    description: "I poisoned myself with nutmeg",
    content: `I've been enjoying making smoothies for breakfast and the last of couple days I've decided to spice things up with some freshly grated nutmeg. Since I have a bag with 15 nuts I thought I could be more generous with the spice today. I ended up adding half a nut (around 3 grams) and boy have the last few hours been miserable. Stomach discomfort, anxiety, dizziness. Almost like a panic attack. A quick search revealed that nutmeg is indeed toxic and even as little as 10g or 2tps can make for a long terrible experience. I feel better now but I'm still a little shaky. So this is my new years PSA: go easy on the nutmeg. The worst part of all of this is that earlier today I made apple pie filling with, again, a generous amount of nutmeg. Now I'm too traumatized to try it...\n\nEdit: Thank you for sharing your experiences. I had no idea this was something people experimented with.\nSo my smoothie tasted only of nutmeg but it didn't taste bad? I definitely didn't feel forced to finish it.\nIt seems like I have a dull palate and a sensitive mind. I'll be more restrained with my spice use moving forward.\nI'll also make more pie filling to add to the mix. Thank you for that suggestion.`,

    content: `Is it me, or all of the Brian Flores reports that are coming out are Miami's attempt to discredit him and justify his firing. I've seen reports that he stopped talking to his coaches to how he didn't like that Tua played golf. It is too convenient that all the stuff he supposedly did is coming out now. Miami is basically saying "see he did all these questionable things. We fired him for that and not because we are incompetent. Please like us." If I was a coach I would be wary of working for the dolphin organization.`,
